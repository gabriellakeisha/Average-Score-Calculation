# Average-Score-Calculation
Write a program that calculates students grade based on the average of three scores. Scores entered are between 0 and 100. 
The program must follow the rule below:
1. If the average score is  90 or more the grade is A.
2. If the average score is between 80 and 90 (90 excluded) the program checks the third score. If the third score is greater or equal to 90 the grade is A, otherwise is B.
3. If the average score is between 70 and 80 (80 excluded) the program checks the third score. If the third score is greater or equal to 80 the grade is B, otherwise is C.
4. If the average score is between 60 and 70 (70 excluded) the program checks the third score. If the third score is greater or equal to 70 the grade is C, otherwise is D.
5. If the average score is less than 60 (60 excluded) the program checks the third score. If the third score is greater or equal to 60 the grade is D, otherwise is F.
